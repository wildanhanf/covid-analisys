# About Covid-19 
Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
The virus can spread from an infected personâ€™s mouth or nose in small liquid particles when they cough, sneeze, speak, sing or breathe. These particles range from larger respiratory droplets to smaller aerosols. You can be infected by breathing in the virus if you are near someone who has COVID-19, or by touching a contaminated surface and then your eyes, nose or mouth. The virus spreads more easily indoors and in crowded settings.

According to WHO, as of today, there are 651.918.402 confirmed cases with 6.656.601 deaths.

# Mini Exploration
On this occasion, I explored the covid-19 dataset in 2020, such as finding when the first cases of covid-19 occurred in each country, the ratio of deaths from covid-19 in each country, and visualizing it.
